# 🚀 Advanced Algorithms & DSA – Daily Practice Repository

Welcome to the **Advanced Algorithms & Data Structures** repository.  
This project documents a **consistent, structured, high-quality practice journey** covering:

- Complete **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)**
- **Advanced algorithms** used in competitive programming & FAANG interviews
- **Daily solved problems**, patterns, and optimised solutions
- **C++ implementations** with clean, readable, structured code

---

## 📁 Repository Structure


Each folder contains:
- Problem name  
- C++ solution  
- Time & space complexity  
- Logic explanation in comments  

---

## 🎯 Repository Goals

### 1. **Master DSA end-to-end**
Cover every major interview topic with depth.

### 2. **Learn advanced algorithms (FAANG level)**
Includes:
- Binary Lifting  
- Segment Trees & Fenwick Trees  
- Sliding Window + Two Pointers  
- KMP / Z / Rabin-Karp  
- Dijkstra / Floyd–Warshall  
- Tarjan / Kosaraju  
- Meet-in-the-middle  
- Union-Find optimization  

### 3. **Daily Problem Solving Discipline**
Every day contains:
- 1–5 curated problems  
- Clean C++ implementation  
- Mistakes + learnings  
- Complexity breakdown  

### 4. **Competitive Programming Oriented**
Improve speed, optimisation skills, and pattern recognition (Codeforces, LeetCode, etc.).
